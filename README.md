**This is an alpha, experimental release of Antvel. Everything will change gradually, looking forward to get the best of this awesome product. Thank you for testing!**

# Installation

Antvel uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to manage its dependencies. So, before using it, make sure you have Composer installed on your machine.


First, download the Antvel installer through Composer:

    composer global require "antvel/installer"

Make sure to place the `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin` directory (or the equivalent directory for your OS) in your $PATH so the `antvel` executable can be located by your system.

Once installed, the `antvel install` command will create a fresh copy of the project in the directory you provided. For example, `antvel install` will create a directory named `App-master` containing a fresh Antvel installation with all of its dependencies already installed:

    antvel install
